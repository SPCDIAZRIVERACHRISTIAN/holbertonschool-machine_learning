# TensorFlow V1 Learning Project

This directory is dedicated to learning the fundamentals of TensorFlow V1. The focus is on understanding its key components, building blocks, and processes for training neural networks.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- What is TensorFlow?
- What is a session? What is a graph?
- What are tensors?
- What are variables, constants, and placeholders? How do you use them?
- What are operations? How do you use them?
- What are namespaces? How do you use them?
- How to train a neural network in TensorFlow.
- What is a checkpoint?
- How to save/load a model with TensorFlow.
- What is the graph collection?
- How to add and get variables from the collection.

## Requirements

### General
- **Allowed editors:** `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **python3 (version 3.9)**.
- Your files will be executed with **numpy (version 1.25.2)** and **tensorflow (version 2.15)**.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the **pycodestyle** style (version 2.11.1).
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`).
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`).
- Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module except `import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf`.
- All your files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
