# Decision Tree Exploration

This directory is dedicated to understanding and implementing **decision trees** for machine learning from scratch. Decision trees are foundational tools in data science and machine learning, and building them manually allows us to deepen our understanding of their mechanisms.

## Notes

### Why Build Decision Trees From Scratch?
1. **Skill Confidence**: Understanding the inner workings of tools strengthens our confidence as engineers.
2. **Tool Creation**: When faced with unsolved problems, knowing the underlying principles enables us to build our own solutions.

### Key Insights
- **Historical Foundations**: References 1-3 link to seminal papers where decision tree concepts were first explored.
- **Splitting Nodes**: References 4-9 provide additional explanation about node-splitting criteria.
- **Invention**: William A. Belson is credited for inventing decision trees (see reference 11).
- **Efficiency**: While this implementation is educational, it cannot match the efficiency of Scikit-learn’s decision tree implementations (written in C).
- **Recommended Video**: Reference 10 highlights how to effectively use Scikit-learn’s decision trees and emphasizes best practices.
