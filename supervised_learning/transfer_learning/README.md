# Transfer Learning and CIFAR-10 Classification

The purpose of this directory is to provide an overview of **transfer learning** in machine learning, a basic guide on how to implement it, and an example Python script using Keras (TensorFlow 2.x) to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset.


## What is Transfer Learning?

**Transfer learning** is a technique in machine learning where knowledge gained while solving one problem is applied to a different but related problem. Instead of training a model from scratch on a new dataset, we use a pre-trained model—usually trained on a large, general dataset—and fine-tune (or retrain) parts of it for the new task.

Typical steps in transfer learning:
1. **Choose a pre-trained model**: This model is typically trained on a massive dataset (e.g., ImageNet).
2. **Replace or add final layers**: These layers are responsible for classification on the new task.
3. **Freeze or partially freeze layers**: We keep the convolutional base weights fixed or allow only certain layers to be retrained.
4. **Train/fine-tune**: We then retrain (or fine-tune) these final layers (and possibly some of the earlier layers) with the new dataset.

## Why Use Transfer Learning?

- **Less data requirement**: A model already trained on a large dataset has learned rich features; this reduces the amount of new data needed.
- **Reduced training time**: Training a large CNN from scratch can be very time-consuming; transfer learning drastically speeds this up.
- **Better performance with small datasets**: Often outperforms a model trained from scratch, especially if the new dataset is small.

## How to Implement Transfer Learning?

Here is a concise outline of the steps to perform transfer learning:

1. **Import a Pre-Trained Model**: For example, Keras provides models like VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNet, etc., which are pretrained on ImageNet.
2. **Freeze Layers**: Decide which layers of the pretrained model to freeze (so their weights do not get updated).
3. **Add a Custom Classification Head**: Usually a few Dense layers, and an output layer that matches the number of classes in your dataset.
4. **Compile the Model**: Specify the loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics.
5. **Train (Fine-Tune) the Model**: Train the new top layers (and optionally unfreeze some deeper layers) on your dataset.
