## Time Series Forecasting

# What is Time Series Forecasting?
Time series forecasting is a method used to predict future values based on previously observed data points collected over time. Unlike traditional predictive modeling, where data points are assumed to be independent, time series forecasting explicitly accounts for the temporal structure of the data, such as trends, seasonality, and autocorrelation. Common applications include stock market prediction, weather forecasting, and demand planning.

# What is a Stationary Process?
A stationary process in time series analysis is a stochastic process whose statistical properties, such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation, do not change over time. In other words, a time series is stationary if it does not exhibit trends, seasonality, or other time-dependent structures. Stationarity is a key assumption in many time series forecasting models because it simplifies the modeling process and allows for more accurate predictions.

- **Strict Stationarity**: All moments (mean, variance, etc.) are invariant over time.
- **Weak Stationarity (or Second-Order Stationarity)**: Only the first two moments (mean and variance) are invariant over time.

# What is a Sliding Window?
A sliding window is a technique used in time series analysis to create overlapping subsequences of data that can be used for modeling. It involves moving a fixed-size window across the time series data and using the data points within the window as input features for the model. This method is commonly used in machine learning models to capture local patterns and temporal dependencies in the data.

For example, in a sliding window approach with a window size of 3:
- Window 1: [t1, t2, t3] -> Predict t4
- Window 2: [t2, t3, t4] -> Predict t5
- And so on...

# How to Preprocess Time Series Data
Preprocessing time series data is a crucial step before applying any forecasting model. The main steps typically include:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Identify and fill or interpolate missing data points to maintain the continuity of the time series.
2. **Resampling**: Aggregate or downsample the data to a consistent time interval (e.g., hourly, daily) to remove noise and make the data more manageable.
3. **Detrending and Deseasonalizing**: Remove trends and seasonal components to make the data stationary, if required by the model.
4. **Normalization/Standardization**: Scale the data to a specific range (e.g., [0, 1]) or transform it to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which helps improve the performance of many machine learning models.
5. **Creating Lag Features**: Generate features from previous time steps to use as input for forecasting future values.
6. **Splitting Data**: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model’s performance accurately.

# How to Create a Data Pipeline in TensorFlow for Time Series Data
Creating a data pipeline in TensorFlow for time series data involves several steps to efficiently load, preprocess, and feed the data into a model:

1. **Load Data**: Use `tf.data.Dataset` to load the time series data from files (e.g., CSV) or arrays.
2. **Windowing**: Apply a sliding window approach to create input-output pairs using the `window` and `flat_map` functions in TensorFlow.
3. **Batching**: Group the data into batches using the `batch` function to optimize training efficiency.
4. **Shuffling**: Shuffle the training data to prevent the model from learning the order of the data, which can lead to overfitting.
5. **Prefetching**: Use the `prefetch` function to overlap the data loading and model training, improving the training speed.
6. **Normalization**: Apply any necessary normalization or standardization directly within the pipeline to ensure the model receives data in the correct format.

Example in TensorFlow:

```python
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(time_series_data)
dataset = dataset.window(size=window_size, shift=1, drop_remainder=True)
dataset = dataset.flat_map(lambda window: window.batch(window_size))
dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size).batch(batch_size).prefetch(1)

Let’s attempt to use our knowledge of RNNs to attempt just that.Given thecoinbaseandbitstampdatasets, write a script,forecast_btc.py, that creates, trains, and validates a keras model for the forecasting of BTC:Your model should use the past 24 hours of BTC data to predict the value of BTC at the close of the following hour (approximately how long the average transaction takes):The datasets are formatted such that every row represents a 60 second time window containing:The start time of the time window in Unix timeThe open price in USD at the start of the time windowThe high price in USD within the time windowThe low price in USD within the time windowThe close price in USD at end of the time windowThe amount of BTC transacted in the time windowThe amount of Currency (USD) transacted in the time windowThevolume-weighted average pricein USD for the time windowYour model should use an RNN architecture of your choosingYour model should use mean-squared error (MSE) as its cost functionYou should use atf.data.Datasetto feed data to your modelBecause the dataset israw, you will need to create a script,preprocess_data.pyto preprocess this data.
