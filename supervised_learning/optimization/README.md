# Machine Learning Optimization

This directory is dedicated to studying and practicing **machine learning optimization** techniques. Optimization plays a crucial role in training robust and efficient models. In particular, learning how to tune hyperparameters, apply various gradient descent strategies, and implement techniques like batch normalization can significantly improve a modelâ€™s performance.

Below are the objectives and requirements for this project:

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, **without the help of Google**:

### General

1. What is a hyperparameter?
2. How and why do you normalize your input data?
3. What is a saddle point?
4. What is stochastic gradient descent?
5. What is mini-batch gradient descent?
6. What is a moving average? How do you implement it?
7. What is gradient descent with momentum? How do you implement it?
8. What is RMSProp? How do you implement it?
9. What is Adam optimization? How do you implement it?
10. What is learning rate decay? How do you implement it?
11. What is batch normalization? How do you implement it?

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.9)
- Your files will be executed with `numpy` (version 1.25.2) and `tensorflow` (version 2.15)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.11.1)
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation
  (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and
  `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
- Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module except `import numpy as np` and/or `import tensorflow as tf`
- You should not import any module unless it is being used
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Notes

- axis in numpy: 0 = the operation is performed along the columns and 1 = operation is performed along the rows

**Happy learning and experimenting with machine learning optimizations!**
