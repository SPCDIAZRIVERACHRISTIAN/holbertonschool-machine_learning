# Supervised Learning

This directory is dedicated to supervised learning, a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from a training dataset that includes both the input data and the corresponding output labels. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs that can be used to predict the labels of new, unseen data.

## Key Concepts

- **Training Data**: A dataset that includes input-output pairs used to train the model.
- **Labels**: The output values or categories that the model is trying to predict.
- **Model**: The mathematical representation that the algorithm uses to make predictions.
- **Prediction**: The output generated by the model when given new input data.

## Types of Supervised Learning

1. **Regression**: Predicting continuous values. For example, predicting house prices based on features like size, location, etc.
2. **Classification**: Predicting categorical values. For example, classifying emails as spam or not spam.

## Applications

- Image and speech recognition
- Medical diagnosis
- Fraud detection
- Stock market prediction

This directory will contain various projects and exercises related to supervised learning, including implementations of different algorithms and techniques.
