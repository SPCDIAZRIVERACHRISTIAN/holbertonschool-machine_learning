# Neural Network Classification Project

Welcome to the **Neural Network Classification** directory! This repository is dedicated to learning how to perform classification tasks using neural networks. Throughout this project, you’ll build a strong foundation in the concepts and practical steps involved in designing, training, and deploying basic neural networks for classification.

## Overview

In this directory, you will learn about:

- **Model Basics**
  - What is a model?
  - What is supervised learning?
  - What is a prediction?

- **Neural Network Fundamentals**
  - What is a node?
  - What is a weight?
  - What is a bias?
  - What are activation functions? (Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU, Softmax)
  - What is a layer?
  - What is a hidden layer?

- **Logistic Regression**
  - What is Logistic Regression?

- **Loss and Cost Functions**
  - What is a loss function?
  - What is a cost function?

- **Training the Network**
  - What is forward propagation?
  - What is Gradient Descent?
  - What is back propagation?
  - What is a Computation Graph?

- **Parameter Initialization**
  - How to initialize weights/biases
  - The importance of vectorization

- **Data Handling**
  - How to split up your data

- **Multiclass Classification**
  - What is multiclass classification?
  - What is a one-hot vector?
  - How to encode/decode one-hot vectors
  - What is the softmax function and when do you use it?
  - What is cross-entropy loss?

- **Pickling**
  - What is pickling in Python?

By working through these topics, you’ll gain hands-on experience in building neural networks from scratch and become more proficient in both the theory and implementation details.
