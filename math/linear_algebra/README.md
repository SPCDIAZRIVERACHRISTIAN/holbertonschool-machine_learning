## Topics I'll Be Learning

### Core Concepts
- **Matrix Multiplication**
- Understanding the **relationship between matrix multiplication and the dot product**
- Exploring **The Dot Product, Matrix Multiplication, and the Magic of Orthogonal Matrices** (Advanced)
- Working through the **Numpy tutorial** (up to *Shape Manipulation*, excluded)
- Learning **Numpy Basics** (up to *Universal Functions*, included)
- **Array Indexing** techniques
- **Numerical Operations on Arrays**
- Getting comfortable with **Broadcasting**
- Diving into **Numpy Mutations and Broadcasting**
- Understanding and working with **numpy.ndarray**
- Exploring **numpy.ndarray.shape**
- Learning about **numpy.transpose**
- Using **numpy.ndarray.transpose**
- Practicing with **numpy.matmul**

## What I Want to Achieve

By the end of this project, I’ll be able to confidently explain the following concepts **without Googling**:

### General Goals
1. What is a vector?
2. What is a matrix?
3. What is a transpose?
4. What is the shape of a matrix?
5. What is an axis?
6. What is a slice?
7. How do you slice a vector or matrix?
8. What are element-wise operations?
9. How do you concatenate vectors and matrices?
10. What is the dot product?
11. What is matrix multiplication?
12. What is `numpy`?
13. What is parallelization, and why is it important?
14. What is broadcasting?

## How I'll Work on This

### Writing Python Scripts
Here’s how I’ll structure my work:

- **Tools I'll Use:**
  - Editors: `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`
  - My code will run on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** with Python 3.9.
  - Scripts will use `numpy` version 1.25.2.

- **Code Structure Rules:**
  - Every file must end with a new line.
  - The first line of every script will be:
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    ```
  - I’ll include a `README.md` at the root of the project folder to explain everything clearly.

- **Code Quality:**
  - I’ll follow `pycodestyle` guidelines (version 2.11.1).
  - I’ll document every module, class, and function:
    - For modules:
      ```bash
      python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
      ```
    - For classes:
      ```bash
      python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'
      ```
    - For functions:
      ```bash
      python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'
      ```

- **Things I’ll Keep in Mind:**
  - Unless told otherwise, I won’t import extra modules.
  - All files must be executable.
  - I’ll check the file length with the `wc` command to stay compliant.

This project is all about deepening my understanding of Numpy and linear algebra concepts while practicing clean, documented Python programming. By the end, I aim to explain these topics like a pro!
